steps I have taken to generate the wmts classes that map the service response.

1) downloaded the wmts xsd's from: http://schemas.opengis.net/wmts/wmts-1_0_1.zip
2) these depend on ogc ows 1.1. So I downloaded the ows xsd's from: http://schemas.opengis.net/ows/ows-1_1_0.zip
3) these depend on w3c xlink, so I downloaded this from: http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink.xsd‎
4) I extracted all these and put them in the same directory
5) ran xsd.exe from the VS commond prompt. > xsd.exe xlink.xsd owscommon.xsd wmtsGetCapabilities_response.xsd  /classes
6) added this to BruTile/Web/Wmts/Generated/ and got some errors
7) replaced XmlNode with XNode to fix a compile error
8) on 'public BoundingBoxType[] Items' I removed the WGS84BoundingBox attribute to fix an error in the code that xsd.exe generated.
9) on 'public Theme[][] Themes' I added '[]' after Theme in the attribute to fix an error in the code that xsd.exe generated.
